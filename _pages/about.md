I'm currently a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at Franklin and Marshall College where I teach Principles of Economics, Intermediate Macroeconomics, and Econometrics. My research interests include financial macroeconomics, business cycles, financial stability, and monetary theory.
