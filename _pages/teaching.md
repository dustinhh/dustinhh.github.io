### Summary of teaching evaluations

#### Instructor Questions
The following figure shows the mean response to questions relating to instructor effectiveness for each semester that I taught courses; the student survey includes statements about the instructor's effectiveness, which are evaluated on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). The survey questions on instructor effectiveness are: (1) "the instructor was organized;" (2) "the instructor presented course content effectively;" (3) "the instructor created/supported a classroom environment that was respectful;" (4) "the instructor demonstrated thorough knowledge of the subject"; (5) "as appropriate, the instructor encouraged questions and opinions;" (6) "the instructor was available for consultation with students;" (7) "overall, this was an effective instructor." The average score for all courses offered by the economics department is provided for reference.
