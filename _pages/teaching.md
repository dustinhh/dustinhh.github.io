### teaching philosophy
Teaching philosophies are products of our own experiences and are shaped by our perceptions of the purpose of education in general. In my view, the purpose of education is not to produce cogs for the machines of the future, nor is it to provide a cookbook of ready-made skills. Instead, education should help students develop a framework for navigating the social world, one which enables them to separate fact from fiction and to communicate their ideas with clarity and confidence. Fundamentally, the goal of education should be to promote intellectual independence and curiosity, a goal which is achieved in part by pushing students out of their comfort zones and challenging them to reach their full potential.

Through my own experiences as a student, I have realized that learning is not a passive activity. Intellectual-struggle is not only a natural part of the learning process but a crucial one. In a world where more information is readily available at our fingertips than ever before---via online open courses, YouTube, and other digital media sources---the question arises as to what value formal education provides over these freely available resources. The answer to that question lies in the fact that learning requires struggle and formal education forces students to push the boundaries of understanding beyond what they would gain on their own. Through my experience as a student and as an instructor, I have observed that students will often rise to the occasion if challenged to do so.

My goal is to maintain a classroom environment where every student feels like they are a part of the conversation. The first step in achieving this goal is to make students feel personally engaged with the course material and understand its relevance in their life. As an instructor, this requires an awareness of the diverse backgrounds of students and the value that comes from the inclusion of historically underrepresented minorities. Economics as a discipline has a [well-documented](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.30.4.221) issue with a lack of diversity in terms of race and gender, which starts at the undergraduate level.

In short, my approach to teaching is focused on maintaining an environment where students feel challenged but also encouraged to ask questions and engage with the material at a deeper level. I  look forward to the opportunity to continue developing my skills as an instructor and to inspire students to reach their full potential.

### summary of teaching evaluations

#### instructor questions
The following figure shows the mean response to questions relating to instructor effectiveness for each semester that I taught courses; the student survey includes statements about the instructor's effectiveness, which are evaluated on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). The survey questions on instructor effectiveness are: (1) "the instructor was organized;" (2) "the instructor presented course content effectively;" (3) "the instructor created/supported a classroom environment that was respectful;" (4) "the instructor demonstrated thorough knowledge of the subject"; (5) "as appropriate, the instructor encouraged questions and opinions;" (6) "the instructor was available for consultation with students;" (7) "overall, this was an effective instructor." The department average (for all courses offered by the economics department) is provided for reference.

#### course questions

The following figure shows the mean response to questions relating to the effectiveness of the course overall; again, responses range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). The survey questions relating to course effectiveness are: (1) "the course objectives were clearly stated;" (2) "the course objectives were met;" (3) "the course content was well organized;" (4) "the course materials were helpful in meeting course objectives;" (5) "assignments and exams reflected what was covered in the course;" (6) "I learned a great deal in this course;" (7) "overall, this was an effective course."
